# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Fall 2021)

My submission for the ACM Research Coding Challenge is an VADER-based analysis
using some NLP techniques from the NLTK library. It is implemented in Python and
uses the IPython kernel to run in a Jupyter Notebook.

You can read [my submission](Coding-Challenge-F21.pdf) or see it rendered as [a notebook](Coding-Challenge-F21.ipynb) in Github.
You can also run it yourself
with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Spaceface16518/Coding-Challenge-F21/HEAD?filepath=Coding-Challenge-F21.ipynb)
